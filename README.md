# mining-bitcoins
This is a project in Scala which uses the Akka framework to mine bitcoins concurrently.   
Steps to run the project  1. Unzip the folder and its contents into the directory you wish to use. 2.a)Use cmd to navigate to the directory,...\BTC_Project\, and type in "sbt run" to run the program with default value of      k=4 and without a remote actor.   b)To run with the remote actor from a different PC, modify the value of "hostname" in the following file, located at        "D:\BTC_Project\src\main\resources\remote_application.conf" to the IP address of the machine.  Work unit size  The work unit size was determined based on the perfomance of the average worker. We ran the miner for a time period of 30 seconds in which time the 12 local miner actors processed on average around 7,000,000 strings. This means that each worker on average is processing about 20,000 strings/second. Having each worker report his findings in every second that he mines would clutter up the message queue. We chose instead to set the work unit at 100,000 (reporting every five seconds) because we felt that it was a nice balance between reporting often enough so that main actor was being kept updated about the progress we were making and not sending too many messages between actors.
